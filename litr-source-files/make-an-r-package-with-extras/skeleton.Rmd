<!-- This Rmd file contains all the code needed to define an R package.  Press "Knit" in RStudio or more generally run `rmarkdown::render("name-of-this-file.Rmd")` to generate the R package.  Remember that when you want to modify anything about the R package, you should modify this document rather than the package that is outputted.
-->

## Package setup

We start by specifying the information needed in the DESCRIPTION file of the R package.

```{r package-setup, message=FALSE, results='hide'}
usethis::create_package(
  path = ".",
  fields = list(
    Package = params$package_name,
    Version = "0.0.0.9000",
    Title = "A Package With a README, Vignette, and Pkgdown Site",
    Description = "This package's purpose is to show how to have a README, vignette, and a pkgdown website using litr.",
    `Authors@R` = person("First", "Last", email = "you@gmail.com",
                         role = c("aut", "cre")
      )
  )
)
usethis::use_mit_license(copyright_holder = "F. Last")
```

## Now to the package itself

This section is nearly identical to the `rhello` template.  The real purpose of this template starts in [this section](#extra).

### Define two functions

Let's define functions that say hello and hi:

```{r}
#' Say hello to someone
#' 
#' @param name Name of a person
#' @param exclamation Whether to include an exclamation mark
#' @export 
say_hello <- function(name, exclamation = TRUE) {
  paste0("Hello ", name, ifelse(exclamation, "!", "."))
}

#' Say hi to someone
#' 
#' @param name Name of a person
#' @param exclamation Whether to include an exclamation mark
#' @export 
say_hi <- function(name, exclamation = TRUE) {
  paste0("Hi ", name, ifelse(exclamation, "!", "."))
}
```

## Document the package

This should happen before the pkgdown part.

```{r}
rm(list = ls())
litr::document()
```

## Add extra items {#extra}

This is the main point of this template.  In addition to this .Rmd file, we'll need a folder with a few extra source files (e.g., a hex sticker, a README.Rmd, vignettes, etc.).  That folder and the files within it should be created yourself (i.e., they are not created by this .Rmd file).  The standard layout when creating a package called `mypkg` is to have a directory called `mypkg-project` that has `create-mypkg.Rmd` and also `source-files/` in it.  Once you litr-knit `create-mypkg.Rmd`, `mypkg-project` will also have `create-mypkg.html` and the package `mypkg` in it.

### Add a hex sticker

This part is optional, but suppose you've made a hex sticker for your package.^[You can make it in R with [this tool](https://github.com/GuangchuangYu/hexSticker)!]  You'd put it in the `source-files` directory.  We'll use the `litr` hex for this example, even though technically we should have created a "withpkgdown" sticker for this example.

```{r}
litr::add_hex_sticker("../source-files/litr-hex.png")
```

### Add a README

Our README.Rmd lives in the `source-files` directory.  As described [here](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/reference/build_home.html#package-logo), if we have a hex sticker, we'll add something like the following to the level-one header at the top of the README:

```
# withpkgdown: An Example Package <img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" height="139" />
```

We add `README.Rmd` to the package and then generate the `README.md` based on it:

```{r}
litr::add_readme("../source-files/README.Rmd")
```

### Add a vignette

```{r}
litr::add_vignettes("../source-files/using-this-package.Rmd")
```

### Add a pkgdown site

First, let's include the github link of our package as the URL so that we can have a link to it on our pkgdown site.

```{r}
usethis:::use_description_field(
  "URL",
  "https://github.com/jacobbien/litr-project/tree/main/examples/make-an-r-package-with-extras/withpkgdown"
)
```

Be sure that this next command appears after `litr::document()` has been called in this file.

```{r}
litr::add_pkgdown("../source-files/_pkgdown.yml")
```

You can call `add_pkgdown()` without the argument; however, here we are providing a customized _pkgdown.yml file.  See [this `pkgdown` vignette](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/articles/customise.html) for how to customize your site.  Here is the contents of the `_pkgdown.yml` that was used:

```{r comment=''}
cat(readLines("../source-files/_pkgdown.yml"), sep = '\n')
```

After this step, you can locally see the site by opening `docs/index.html` in the browser.  You can then copy the `docs` directory to your website's server and you're done.
