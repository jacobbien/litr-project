\description{
This chunk hook detects whether a chunk is defining a function or dataset
to be included in the R package (looks for the Roxygen2 comment format \verb{#' }).
If so, then it is written to the \verb{R/} directory.  It also looks for chunks
that have one or more lines that start with \verb{test_that(} or
\verb{testthat::test_that(} (potentially with some leading whitespace).  These
chunks are then written to the \code{tests} directory of the R package.
