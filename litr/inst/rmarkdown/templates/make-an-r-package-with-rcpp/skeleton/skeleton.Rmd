<!-- This Rmd file contains all the code needed to define an R package.  Press "Knit" in RStudio or more generally run `litr::render("name-of-this-file.Rmd")` to generate the R package.  Remember that when you want to modify anything about the R package, you should modify this document rather than the package that is outputted.
-->

## Package setup

We start by specifying the information needed in the DESCRIPTION file of the R package.

```{r package-setup, message=FALSE, results='hide'}
usethis::create_package(
  path = ".",
  fields = list(
    Package = params$package_name,
    Version = "0.0.0.9000",
    Title = "A Package That Uses Rcpp Code",
    Description = "This package uses Rcpp.",
    `Authors@R` = person(
      given = "First",
      family = "Last",
      email = "you@gmail.com",
      role = c("aut", "cre")
      )
  )
)
usethis::use_mit_license(copyright_holder = "F. Last")
```

Add some package-level documentation if you want to (or delete the chunk entirely).  This is what will show up when someone types `package?withrcpp` in the console.

```{package_doc}
#' My great package
#'
#' Here's an overview of the package.
#' 
#' @docType package
#' @seealso \code{\link{alternate_signs}}
```

## Now to the package itself

### Define a function

Let's define a function written in C++ for our R package:

We now define a code chunk using Rcpp.  Notice that instead of the chunk starting with `{R`, it instead starts with `{Rcpp`.  The code in this chunk will be placed in the proper place in the R package.  Use Roxygen2 to document this as you would an R function, except instead of `#'` at the start of each line, use `//'`.  Including the line `// [[Rcpp::export]]` is important for this to work.

```{Rcpp}
#include <Rcpp.h>
using namespace Rcpp;

//' Alternately flip the signs of elements of a vector
//' 
//' @param v A numerical vector
//' @export
// [[Rcpp::export]]
NumericVector alternate_signs(NumericVector v) {
  int n = v.size();
  NumericVector out(n);
  for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (i % 2 == 0) {
      out[i] = v[i];
    }
    else {
      out[i] = -v[i];
    }
  }
  return out;
}
```

We can try running it.

```{r}
alternate_signs(1:10)
```

Great!  Note: If you're not going to call the function within this Rmd file, you can set `eval=FALSE`.  This will speed up the knitting process a bit (and the code will still be included in the package).


Let's write some tests to make sure the function behaves as desired:

```{r}
testthat::test_that("alternate_signs works", {
  testthat::expect_equal(alternate_signs(1:3), c(1, -2, 3))
  testthat::expect_equal(alternate_signs(c(-4, 2)), c(-4, -2))
})
```

Recall that code chunks that have one or more lines starting with `test_that(` (or `testthat::test_that(`) are added to the package as tests.

## Documenting the package and building

We finish by running commands that will document, build, and install the package.  It may also be a good idea to check the package from within this file.

```{r}
rm(list = ls())
litr::document() # <-- use instead of devtools::document()
# devtools::build()
# devtools::install()
# devtools::check(document = FALSE)
```
