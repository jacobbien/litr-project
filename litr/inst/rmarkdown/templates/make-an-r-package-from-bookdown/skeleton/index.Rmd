# Introduction

You can introduce what your R package does here.

**Note:** If you are working in RStudio, you can simply press "Knit" to render this bookdown (and open `_book/index.html` to see the result).  More generally, in a console you can run the following:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
litr::render("index.Rmd", output_format = litr::litr_gitbook())
```
