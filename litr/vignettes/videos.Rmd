For those who prefer to learn from video, here are a sequence of videos for getting started with `litr`:

1. **Quickstart Video.** This video shows how little time it takes to get started with `litr`.

2. **A Full Literate Programming Example.** This video walks through the entire process of writing an R package with `litr`.  Our example is an R package that fits least squares.  We show how latex equations and plots can be used to explain code.  We also show how to write a unit test (using the `testthat` R package).

3. **Using Rcpp in an R Package.** We show how to add `Rcpp` code to an R package using `litr`. We continue the least squares example from our previous video.  We use `RcppArmadillo` and see that it makes our least squares function 3x faster.

4. Next video planned: **Using `litr` with `bookdown`.** If you are interested in this topic, for now you can look at [an example](https://gregfaletto.github.io/cssr-project/create/) where `litr` and `bookdown` are used together (full github repo [here](make-an-r-package-from-bookdown)).  To get started, you can run the following command in an R session:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
litr::draft_bookdown("frombookdown")
```
