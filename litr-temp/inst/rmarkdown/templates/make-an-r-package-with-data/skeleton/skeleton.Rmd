<!-- This Rmd file contains all the code needed to define an R package.  Press "Knit" in RStudio or more generally run `litr::render("name-of-this-file.Rmd")` to generate the R package.  Remember that when you want to modify anything about the R package, you should modify this document rather than the package that is outputted.

## Package setup

We start by specifying the information needed in the DESCRIPTION file of the R package.

```{r package-setup, message=FALSE, results='hide'}
usethis::create_package(
  path = ".",
  fields = list(
    Package = params$package_name,
    Version = "0.0.0.9000",
    Title = "A Package That Has Data",
    Description = "This package has a dataset.  It could also have some functions, but for now all it has is some data.",
    `Authors@R` = person(
      given = "First",
      family = "Last",
      email = "you@gmail.com",
      role = c("aut", "cre")
      )
  )
)
usethis::use_mit_license(copyright_holder = "F. Last")
```

## Now to the package itself

### Create a dataset

In this case, we'll create the data from scratch.  However, we can also download data from a different source here.

```{r}
set.seed(123)
n <- 100
x <- rnorm(n)
y <- 2 * x + 0.3 * rnorm(n)
mydata <- data.frame(x = x, y = y)
```

Let's have a look:

```{r}
plot(y ~ x, data = mydata)
```

Now, let's send this off to the package:

```{r}
usethis::use_data(mydata)
```

And we'll need to document the dataset as well:

```{r}
#' A regression data set
#' 
#' @format A data frame with 100 rows and 2 variables:
#' \describe{
#' \item{x}{a predictor variable}
#' \item{y}{a response variable}
#' @source This data was simulated.  But usually we might cite a source here.
"mydata"
```

## Documenting the package and building

We finish by running commands that will document, build, and install the package.  It may also be a good idea to check the package from within this file.

```{r}
rm(list = ls())
litr::document() # <-- use instead of devtools::document()
# devtools::build()
# devtools::install()
# devtools::check(document = FALSE)
```
