This package's purpose is to show how to use [litr](https://github.com/jacobbien/litr-project/tree/main/litr) to create a package with a README, a vignette, a pkgdown site, and (of course) a hex sticker.  We can see the result of all of that at this package's website [here](https://jacobbien.github.io/withpkgdown-project/).

## Getting started

Put instructions here for how to install your package:

```{r}
# [change "jacobbien" to your github username]
# remotes::install_github("jacobbien/withpkgdown-project", subdir = "withpkgdown")
```
