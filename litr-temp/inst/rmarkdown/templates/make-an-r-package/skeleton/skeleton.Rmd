<!-- This Rmd file contains all the code needed to define an R package.  Press "Knit" in RStudio or more generally run `litr::render("name-of-this-file.Rmd")` to generate the R package.  Remember that when you want to modify anything about the R package, you should modify this document rather than the package that is outputted.
-->

## Package setup

We start by specifying the information needed in the DESCRIPTION file of the R package.

```{r package-setup, message=FALSE, results='hide'}
usethis::create_package(
  path = ".",
  fields = list(
    Package = params$package_name,
    Version = "0.0.0.9000",
    Title = "A Package That Says Hello",
    Description = "This package says hello.  But its actual purpose is to show how an R package can be completely coded in a single R markdown file.",
    `Authors@R` = person(
      given = "First",
      family = "Last",
      email = "you@gmail.com",
      role = c("aut", "cre")
      )
  )
)
usethis::use_mit_license(copyright_holder = "F. Last")
```

## Now to the package itself

### Define a function

Let's define a function for our R package:

```{r}
#' Say hello to someone
#' 
#' @param name Name of a person
#' @param exclamation Whether to include an exclamation mark
#' @export 
say_hello <- function(name, exclamation = TRUE) {
  paste0("Hello ", name, ifelse(exclamation, "!", "."))
}
```

Code chunks whose first line starts with `#'` are added to the package.

We can try running it.

```{r}
say_hello("Jacob")
```

That code chunk does not start with `#'`, so it is not added to the package.

Let's write some tests to make sure the function behaves as desired:

```{r}
testthat::test_that("say_hello works", {
  testthat::expect_equal(say_hello("Jacob"), "Hello Jacob!")
  testthat::expect_equal(say_hello("Jacob", exclamation = FALSE), "Hello Jacob.")
})
```

Code chunks that have one or more lines starting with `test_that(` (or `testthat::test_that(`) are added to the package as tests.

## Documenting the package and building

We finish by running commands that will document, build, and install the package.  It may also be a good idea to check the package from within this file.

```{r}
rm(list = ls())
litr::document() # <-- use instead of devtools::document()
# devtools::build()
# devtools::install()
# devtools::check(document = FALSE)
```
