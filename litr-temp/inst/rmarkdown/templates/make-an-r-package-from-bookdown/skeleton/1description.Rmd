# Package setup

Every R package needs a DESCRIPTION file, so we start by specifying this information:

```{r package-setup, message=FALSE, results='hide'}
usethis::create_package(
  path = ".",
  fields = list(
    Package = params$package_name,
    Version = "0.0.0.9000",
    Title = "A Package Defined in a Bookdown",
    Description = "This package uses litr to define an R package through writing a bookdown.",
    `Authors@R` = person(
      given = "First",
      family = "Last",
      email = "you@gmail.com",
      role = c("aut", "cre")
      )
  )
)
usethis::use_mit_license(copyright_holder = "F. Last")
```

Although it's not required, it can be nice to add some package-level documentation.  This is what will show up when someone types `package?<your-package-name>` in the console.

```{package_doc}
#' A Package Defined in a Bookdown
#'
#' This package uses `litr` to define an R package through writing a `bookdown`.
#' 
#' @docType package
```
