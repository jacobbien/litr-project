# The basics of saying hello

Let's define a function for our R package:

```{r}
#' Say hello to someone
#' 
#' @param name Name of a person
#' @param exclamation Whether to include an exclamation mark
#' @export 
say_hello <- function(name, exclamation = TRUE) {
  paste0("Hello ", name, ifelse(exclamation, "!", "."))
}
```

Code chunks whose first line starts with `#'` are added to the package.

We can try running it.

```{r}
say_hello("Jacob")
```

That code chunk does not start with `#'`, so it is not added to the package.

Let's write some tests to make sure the function behaves as desired:

```{r}
testthat::test_that("say_hello works", {
  testthat::expect_equal(say_hello("Jacob"), "Hello Jacob!")
  testthat::expect_equal(say_hello("Jacob", exclamation = FALSE), "Hello Jacob.")
})
```

Code chunks that have one or more lines starting with `test_that(` (or `testthat::test_that(`) are added to the package as tests.
