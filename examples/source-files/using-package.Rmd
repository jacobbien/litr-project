This vignette describes how to use this package.  You start by loading the package.

```{r}
library(withpkgdown)
```

### Saying hello

To say hello, you use the `say_hello()` function:

For example, to say hello to someone named Jacob, you'd do the following:

```{r}
say_hello("Jacob")
```

### Saying hi

To say hi to someone, one would use the following:

```{r}
say_hi("Jacob")
```

### More advanced use

You can control the punctuation by using the `exclamation` argument:

```{r}
say_hello("Jacob", exclamation=FALSE)
```
